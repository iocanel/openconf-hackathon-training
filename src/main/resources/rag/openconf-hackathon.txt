Mentoring

The Importance of Mentors
Mentors are crucial to the success of our hackathon, providing invaluable guidance and expertise that elevate the quality of the participants‚Äô work. Their experience in the industry or academia not only helps teams navigate challenges and refine their ideas but also fosters an environment of learning and growth. By offering targeted advice, constructive feedback, and support, mentors play a pivotal role in helping teams reach their full potential, ensuring that innovative solutions are developed and that participants leave the event with enhanced skills and knowledge. Their involvement is key to creating a meaningful and impactful hackathon experience.  Mentors will provide in general guidance in the following areas based on their expertise:

Founder/Entrepreneur
AI/ML/GenAI usage
Software Architecture
Engineering (backend, full-stack, mobile app)
UI/UX Design
Business/Marketing/Legal
Sustainability solutions
Mentoring Execution
Mentoring guidance during the physical event will be done in the following formats.

Initial mentoring ‚Äì initial teams pitching
Mentor slots (1:1)
Ad-hoc mentoring
 
Initial mentoring
On the first day of the hackathon, Thursday, November 21, all teams will provide an initial pitch to the mentors assigned to that timeslot. Each team will have a total of 5 minutes for their initial pitch, divided into 2-3 minutes for pitching and 2 minutes for Q&A. Mentors will have access to the teams‚Äô ideas beforehand, based on the information provided during team registration. 

Mentor slots
Each mentor will have an agenda with 15-minute slots that teams can book for consultations. Participants can use the provided booking tool to select and reserve a slot to speak with a mentor of their preference. Meetings with mentors will take place in designated areas based on availability. Bookings must be made by the teams at least 30 minutes prior to the appointment. For example, a timeslot at 11:00 AM must be booked no later than 10:30 AM to allow mentors to have a clear view of their upcoming appointments.

Ad Hoc
Another form of mentoring will be ad-hoc guidance provided to the teams by mentors. This can be initiated both ways:  
 
Triggered by teams  
Teams may seek help from a mentor in the designated mentor area if a mentor is available. Teams can ask if a mentor is free and, if the mentor agrees, they can sit together for a short discussion.  
Alternatively, teams can request help from mentors through the Discord chat using the public ‚Äúmentors‚Äô request‚Äù channel. In this case, it is understood that assistance is provided on a best-effort basis, depending on the availability of a mentor at that time. This method should primarily be used to get advice on which mentor is most appropriate for the team‚Äôs needs, after which they can find the mentor and book a slot with them.  
  
Triggered by mentors  
Mentors will walk around the teams, offering assistance, asking about their implementation processes, and providing guidance.

Judging

The Importance of Judges
Judges are crucial to the success of our hackathon; they bring in their invaluable critical thinking and expertise to evaluate and recognize the quality of the participants‚Äô work. Their experience in industry or academia not only puts them in a unique position to identify the most innovative and outstanding projects but also fosters an environment of fairness and transparency for the competition. A diverse panel of judges will ensure that the outcome is fair and well-substantiated, as it will be evaluated from multiple perspectives. This diversity brings a breadth of experience and insight, which enhances the validity and comprehensiveness of the final decision. 

Judging Process

Hackathon goal is to ensure a fair, transparent, and efficient judging process that accurately reflects the quality and innovation of each team‚Äôs project. To achieve this, we have designed a two-phase evaluation system that allows for both individual and collective assessments by the panel of judges.

The teams will be invited to present their projects live to the judging panel. Each presentation will be followed by a brief Q&A session, where judges can probe deeper into specific aspects of the project. This stage is crucial for assessing how well teams can articulate their ideas, respond to feedback, and demonstrate the functionality of their solutions in real-time.

During a team‚Äôs presentation, each judge will fill in the team‚Äôs score in their scoreboard, assigning score points to each criterion. This step will be conducted individually and in private by each judge to ensure an unbiased assessment of every project.

After the final presentations by the teams have concluded, the judging panel will convene in private to discuss and identify the top-performing teams. In this private meeting, judges can ask each other clarifying questions and engage in discussions, and potentially adjust their individual scorecard. This collaborative process is designed to ensure that all perspectives are considered, and that discrepancies in scoring can be addressed through open dialogue. At the end of this private meeting, the judges are expected to have finalized their private scores on their scorecards.

Finally, the scores from all judges will be summed together to produce the final score for each team, thus determining the final scoreboard and the winning teams.
